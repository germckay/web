As I am more familiar with R, I wrote code that extracts information about the game by turn, including authority, cards gained, cards scrapped, and more. After learning about WebR, I was curious to see if I could run a simplified version of the script that looks only at authority for both players throughout the game. After a bit of learning and research, was able to do so. You can copy your game log and paste it in the text box above, click run, and see a display of authority levels throughout the game."
